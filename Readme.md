# Alumni Donation Analysis Project

This project is a collaboration between our group and the Gies Advancement Office's Data Department. Our goal is to help analyze alumni donation-related data, including exploring features, variables, correlations, and potential prediction models for donation likelihoods.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find various data analysis tasks related to alumni donations at Gies College of Business. The tasks include:

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables, with significance testing to validate the strength and reliability of these relationships.
- Data visualization to better understand donation patterns
- Machine learning models for predicting donation likelihoods
- Conducted cluster analysis (K-Means, DBSCAN) to uncover group patterns
