# Alumni Donation Analysis Project

This project is a collaboration between our group and the Gies Advancement Office's Data Department. Our goal is to help analyze alumni donation-related data, including exploring features, variables, correlations, and potential prediction models for donation likelihoods.

In this repository, you will find various data analysis tasks related to alumni donations at Gies College of Business. The tasks include:

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables
- Data visualization to better understand donation patterns
- Machine learning models for predicting donation likelihoods
- Cluster Analysis like K-Means and DBSCAN to gain groups patterns.
